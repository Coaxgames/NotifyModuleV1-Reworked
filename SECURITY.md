## When an update Applies what version am i put onto?
When updating Notify, it will target the Newest version, if you report an issue we 
will revert to the old one and retest the broken version

If an issue is present and we havnt got to it then a GUI Menu will Used to select a secure version(Still working on this)
By using this GUI you will be shown Every version that is available,
OR you can revert to the cached version by clicking "Undo Update" (Still working on this ad well!)



## Reporting a Vulnerability
