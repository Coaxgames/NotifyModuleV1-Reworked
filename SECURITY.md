##When an update Applies what version am i put onto?
When updating Notify, it will target the Newest version, if you report an issue we 
will revert to the old one and retest the broken version

If an issue is present and we havnt got to it then a GUI Menu will Used to select a secure version(Still working on this)

OR you can revert to the cached version by clicking "Undo Update" (Still working on this ad well!)



## Reporting a Vulnerability
Post in Issues AND create a request with your Error logs
doing both will have a higher chance of review and a commit being allowed

Any version is allowed to run, but they will be flagged here
